# sumtop-2018-lightlab-demo

As a demo master, update Demo.ipynb with your hostname and run server.py in your computer.


## Instructions

To download the files in this demo, use (`https://github.com/thomaslima/sumtop-2019-lightlab-demo.git`) or [download as a zip file](https://github.com/thomaslima/sumtop-2019-lightlab-demo/archive/master.zip).

To follow the demo, make sure you have python3.6 or greater installed, then install lightlab and jupyter via pip*, launch a jupyter notebook server and finally open `Demo.ipynb`. For those using Mac or Linux, typing `make jupyter` should prepare your environment automatically. (caveat, you need python3 and virtualenv to be in your path).

* to install packages via pip, type `pip install package-name`. For conda users, you might first need to install pip with `conda install pip`.

### If you have conda...

``` bash
conda install pip
pip install jupyter
pip install lightlab
```
